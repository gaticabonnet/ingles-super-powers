    <center><h1>FAMILY IS IMPORTANT</h1></center>
    <center><p>Mr. Incredible thinks he can catch Syndrome, but he needs his family and all their super powers. Mr. Incredible asks for help to his family and finally, they can get the villain.</p></center>
    <center><p>The family is like a special team where each member is important. Imagine that your family is like a big, strong tree. Grandparents are the roots, parents are the trunk, and children are the leaves that make the tree beautiful. </p></center>
    <center><p>Together, they work to protect the members, and they help each other. Family is important because it is where we learn to love, share and be happy. It's a group of superheroes who are always there for you.</p></center>
